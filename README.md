# Modularity_algorithm_NN
Using this algorithm, one can extract the main brain modular structures ), which fluctuate over time during rest and task. . The proposed framework simply takes as input a set of connectivity matrices, without making any constraint on how these matrices are computed.

The function "Categorical_modularity_NN" detects the categorical modular structures while the "Sequential_modularity_NN" extracts the sequential modular structures. 
One should run either Categorical_modularity_NN.m or sequential_modlarity_NN.m depending on his application. 

Remark: genlouvain-2.1 should be added to the matlab path while running the code.
